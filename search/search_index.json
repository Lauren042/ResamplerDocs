Flag Range Default Description g [-100, 100] 0 Alters the perceived gender of the voice. Positive values are male; negative are female. t [-1200, 1200] 0 Shifts the pitch by a number of cents. 1 cent = 1/100th of a semitone. P [0, 100] 86 A peak compressor. When set to 100, it normalizes the peak of the output waveform to half of its maximum level. When set to 0, it doesn't normalize the output at all. For a number between 0 and 100, the degree of normalization is interpolated. Only effective in moresampler when synthesis-utau-style-normalization is on. A [-100, 100] 0 Amplitude modulation. This flag modulates the amplitude in correlation with change of pitch. It could be helpful for creating realistic vibratos. The sign (positive or negative) controls the direction of such modulation. The formula for amplitude gain \\(2^{10^{-5}A\\frac{d}{dt}c(t)}\\) , where \\(c(t)\\) is a function mapping time (seconds) to pitch (cents). b [-20, 100] 0 Amplitude gain for unvoiced consonants. This flag amplifies or attenuates unvoiced consonants (e.g. /t/, /k/, /s/) by a factor of 0.05 times the number after b. It has less or no effect for voiced consonants (e.g. /g/, /m/). e None None Force resampler to extend sustained vowels by stretching (time scaling), as opposed to looping. Opposte to moresampler's Me , which forces looping instead. By default, the duration extension method is specified by the synthesis-duration-extension-method option. u None None Send input directly to output without any processing (such as pitch shifting, time scaling or timbre adjustment). This flag is useful for adding sound effects, for example, breathing sound to the project because you may not want them to be pitch-shifted. This flag is equivalent to a less-known feature in UTAU: adding $direct=true to the note settings.","title":"resampler.exe"},{"location":"flags/#resampler-flags","text":"The following is a list of the default UTAU resampler's flags.
